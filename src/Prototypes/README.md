Mixture Starter Project
======================

A starter project for begining mixture projects.

Mixture Starter is ideal as a prototype start point to get up and running with a production ready project structure.

### What this is not
This is not intended to be a fully fledged framework that is a silver bullet for creating UI's, it is a solid starting point with a structure that I like to setup my projects with.

###Technologies/frameworks
